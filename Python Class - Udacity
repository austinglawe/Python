## Why Python Programming
History of Python - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python

Programming in python
- Case Sensitive
- Spacing matters
- Use error messages to help you learn

print()



## Arithmetic Operators 2.2

+ (Addition)
- (subtraction) 
* (Multiplication)
/ (Division)
% (Modulo, the remainder after dividing)
// (Integer Division, divides and rounds down to the nearest integer)
** Exponentatiation (note that ^ does not do this operation, as you might have seen in other languages)
^ (bitwise XOR) not exponentatiation

-- Regular order of operations apply
-- Math Refresher --> https://www.nctm.org/classroomresources/
-- More Special operators ---> https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators

print(3+5)
8 (output)

print(7 // 2)
3

print(-7 // 2)
-4

("//" always rounds DOWN)



## Quiz: Arithmetic Operators

It's time to try a calculation in Python!
--My electricity bills for the last three months have been $23, $32 and $64. What is the average monthly electricity bill over the three month period? Write an expression to calculate the mean, and use print() to view the result.
# Write an expression that calculates the average of 23, 32 and 64
# Place the expression in this print statement

Answer: print((23 + 32 + 64)/3)

-In this quiz you're going to do some calculations for a tiler. Two parts of a floor need tiling. One part is 9 tiles wide by 7 tiles long, the other is 5 tiles wide by 7 tiles long. Tiles come in packages of 6.
-[1]-How many tiles are needed?
-[2]-You buy 17 packages of tiles containing 6 tiles each. How many tiles will be left over?

# Fill this in with an expression that calculates how many tiles are needed.

Answer: print(9*7 + 5*7)

# Fill this in with an expression that calculates how many tiles will be left over.

Answer: print(17*6 - (9*7 + 5*7))

--Which of these lines of Python code are well formatted? How would you improve the readability of the codes that don't use good formatting? (Choose all that apply)
[] print(((3+ 32))+ -15//2)
[x] print((17 - 6)%(5 + 2))
[] print ((1 + 2 + 4) / 13)
[x] print(4/2 - 7*7)

####FEEDBACK:
###Well done on thinking about good Python formatting! Practicing good formatting when coding is the best way to get good at it. Here is what we thought:
   The first one isn't well formatted; it has some extra spaces, extra parentheses and an extra +. It would look much clearer as
   print((3 + 32) - 15//2)
   The second one looks good, it's got extra spaces around the - and + to help with readability.
   The third one looks quite clear, though it could be a bit better by removing the space between print and ( and the spaces around the /.
   print((1 + 2 + 4)/13)
   The final one looks fine.
