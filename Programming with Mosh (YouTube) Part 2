## while loops are to execute a block of code multiple times
##### for loops
## iterate (repeat) over items of a collection such as a string
## because a string is a sequence of characters, so it looks like a collection
# after the for, you define a variable, a loop variable
# in each iteration, this variable will hold one item

for item in 'Python':
    print(item)


## Define a list using square brackets, like so:
## [] ... you can have a list of items, like products, names, emails, numbers.. so on

for item in ['Mosh', 'John', 'Sarah']:
    print(item)

for num in [1, 2 , 3, 4]:
    print(num)

for numbers in range(10):
    print(numbers)
## 10 is not included

for numbers in range(5, 10, 2):
    print(numbers)
# here the first number starts at 5, the last ends at 9 (before 10).
# lastly it skips 2 numbers at a time.



### to print the end result of sum of all prices in prices
prices = [10, 20, 30]

total = 0
for price in prices:
    total += price
print(f"Total: {total}")

## if you want a running total each time the price is calculated
prices = [10, 20, 30]

total = 0
for price in prices:
    total += price
    print(f"Total: {total}")


## Nested loops
## adding one loop inside another loop
## with these you can add coordinates like so:
## (x, y) ----> (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)

for x in range(4):
    for y in range (3):
        print(f"({x}, {y})")

## this executes as, the first iteration of the outer loop x is 0
## the second line of code is a new loop, an inner loop, the first iteration y is 0
## then it will print 0,0 in the terminal
## then it will jump back up to the inner loop and go up to 2 (quits before hitting 3)
## once it hits that limit, it will jump back to the outer loop and go through the same process
