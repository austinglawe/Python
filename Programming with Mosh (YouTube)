## Variables

price = 10

# price = 20 now because code is read line by line and can be updated
rating = 4.9
my_name = 'Austin'
is_published = True
# Python is sensitive to upper- and lowercase characters
# Always use lowercase letters
# but python words False and True need to be uppercase for T or F
# _ (underscores are used instead of spaces)
# price, rating, my_name are all variables
# Integer is a whole number (like price)
# Float is a number with a decimal (like rating)
# Strings are characters that are not numbers
# Boolean values are True or False

# We check in a patient named John Smith. He's 20 years old and is a new patient.
