## Your First Python Code:

--INPUT:
print("Austin Glawe")
print("o----")
print(" ||||")
print('*' * 10)

---OUTPUT:
Austin Glawe
o----
 ||||
**********



## Variables

price = 10
price = 20
print(price)
# price = 20 now because code is read line by line and can be updated
rating = 4.9
my_name = 'Austin'
is_published = True
# Python is sensitive to upper- and lowercase characters
# Always use lowercase letters
# but python words False and True need to be uppercase for T or F
# _ (underscores are used instead of spaces)
# price, rating, my_name are all variables
# Integer is a whole number (like price)
# Float is a number with a decimal (like rating)
# Strings are characters that are not numbers
# Boolean values are True or False

# We check in a patient named John Smith. He's 20 years old and is a new patient.
# Create 3 variables to define these factors above
name = "John Smith"
age = 20
is_new = True


the input() function is a built in function.
name = input('What is your name? ')
 print ('Hi ' + name)
# concatenating (combining) this string with another string


# Ask what the name is of a person. Then ask their favorite color.
# print these.
name = input('What is your name? ')
fav_color = input(name + ',what is your favorite color? ')
print(name + "'s favorite color is " + fav_color)




# We want to find your age based on an input of your birth year

birth_year = input('Birth year: ')
age = 2023 - birth_year
print(age)
## However this doesn't work, this error appears below:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\austi\PycharmProjects\HelloWorld1\app1.py", line 2, in <module>
    age = 2023 - birth_year
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'int' and 'str'

## It is saying that you can't take and integer (2023) and subtract a string (input of age) from it
## Anything typed in an input terminal is ALWAYS a string.
